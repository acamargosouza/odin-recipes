    <h1>Gnocchi</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/Gnocchi.jpeg">
    <p>Living in Italy has made me realize that the simplest dish can be made in so many different ways, depending on the region or even how the family cooks it.
    That of course also includes how to make Gnocchi. I have been told to use just flour and potatoes, or use  some milk instead. But the best way I found is flour, potatoes and an egg.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>potatoes</li>
        <li>some milk</li>
        <li>egg</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, cut small amounts of dough to form ropes and cut into 3/4 inch (2 cm) pieces, then slide each piece on a fork and squeeze a little (but not too hard).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with a little bit of flour and toss, so they dont stick together.</li>
        <li>Let the gnocchi rest for 20 minutes before cooking.</li>
        <li>In a large pot of salted boiling water cook the gnocchi, gnocchi are ready when they float to the top.</li>
        <li>Drain and toss with desired sauce.</li>
    </ol>
